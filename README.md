# BookChain DApp

BookChain is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to mint, manage, and sell digital books as NFTs (ERC721) using a custom ERC20 token called BOOKY.

## Features

* Mint books as NFTs (ERC721) with metadata (title, author, cover image)
* Manage personal book ownership in Reader Dashboard
* List books for sale and purchase them using BOOKY tokens in Marketplace
* Wallet connection via MetaMask
* Fully styled with Tailwind CSS and includes animations
